# 乌鲁木齐七五事件14周年：镇压与迫害仍在继续

[乌鲁木齐七五事件14周年：镇压与迫害仍在继续 - 要闻解说](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%93%E6%A0%8F%E6%A3%80%E7%B4%A2/%E8%A6%81%E9%97%BB%E8%A7%A3%E8%AF%B4/20230705-%E4%B9%8C%E9%B2%81%E6%9C%A8%E9%BD%90%E4%B8%83%E4%BA%94%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B614%E5%91%A8%E5%B9%B4-%E9%95%87%E5%8E%8B%E4%B8%8E%E8%BF%AB%E5%AE%B3%E4%BB%8D%E5%9C%A8%E7%BB%A7%E7%BB%AD)

今年7月5日是新疆乌鲁木齐七五事件14周年纪念日。流亡海外的维吾尔人团体世界维吾尔代表大会4日发表公告，提醒世人不要忘记在这起事件中死亡、被捕和失踪的维吾尔人，更呼吁国际社会持续关注中国当局在事件之后，在新疆不断升级的镇压与迫害，并“坚持不懈地追究施害者们的罪责。”

7月5日对于维吾尔人来说，是一个惨痛的纪念日。14年前的6月底，广东韶关一家玩具厂发生汉人与维吾尔人之间的严重斗殴事件，至少两名维吾尔人被打死。当地警方对事件的处理引发维吾尔人对执法不公的不满，也在几千里地之外的乌鲁木齐引发集会抗议。7月5日，大约上千名维吾尔人走上街头，要求当局全面调查韶关事件。但原本和平的集会活动演变成维汉两个族群间的暴力冲突，紧张关系迅速白热化。警方强力镇压，控制了局势。中国官方媒体称，几天内，近200人在冲突中丧生，并强调死者多为汉人。但海外流亡维吾尔人团体世界维吾尔代表大会并不认同这项官方数字。世维会发言人迪里夏提接受本台书面采访时指出，“从中国境内通过各种渠道获取的信息，包括七五之后逃到海外来的维吾尔人他们的证词，汇总起来的维吾尔人死亡、伤亡数据和中国政府提供的数据之间反差太大。”，他表示：“为了使外界更准确地来了解真实情况，避免中国利用官方控制的媒体对外界进行欺骗，必须进行独立调查。”

乌鲁木齐七五事件可以说是中国维汉关系的一个重要转折点。此后几年，在当地，也在新疆之外，发生多起与维吾尔人有关的暴力事件，中央政府也以此为由，对新疆地区的高压政策持续升级，原有的民族矛盾日趋尖锐。迪里夏提向本台表示，当年的“广东韶关事件造成数名维吾尔人死亡。当时警方未保护维吾尔人，这反应中国完全无视维吾尔人性命及面临的系统性歧视。”他表示，七五事件的发生并非偶然，也“引爆人们对中国镇压和歧视维吾尔族人的做法的日益愤慨。”

事实上，中国在70年代末期开始的改革开放虽然带动整体经济，尤其是沿海地区经济的快速发展，但边疆地区并未能从这种经济起飞中获利。恰恰相反，日趋严重的社会不平等，也在加剧当地汉人与维吾尔族人之间的矛盾。当时还在北京中央民族学院任教的维吾尔族经济学者伊力哈木-土赫提早在2006年就开办“维吾尔在线“网站，希望推动两大族群间的相互理解，也呼吁政府公平对待不同族群，以对话应对族群矛盾。不过，伊力哈木-土赫提立场温和的呼吁并不为中央政府所乐见。伊力哈木-土赫提最终被捕，并于2014年被司法当局以”分裂国家“罪名判处无期徒刑。

当温和的声音被压制，当局面对不断深化的矛盾，就只剩下强力镇压。这种镇压借助国际打击恐怖主义的行动，以打击伊斯兰极端主义的名义，不断升级。近年来，海外人权团体、学者以及媒体的多项调查报告都显示，自2016年底起，新疆出现多个关押中心，上百万人被任意关押其中。中国政府声称这些中心都是职业培训中心，但得以从这些关押中心生还的经历者的讲述，暴露出其中的酷刑、虐待、强劳等种种暴行。维吾尔人的命运由此引起国际社会广泛关注。欧美一些国家议会相继将维吾尔人的遭遇定为“种族屠杀“。联合国人权事务高级专员办事处2022年8月底，在其高级专员巴切莱特任期结束的最后时刻公布的评估报告也指出，在“更普遍地限制和剥夺个人和集体享有的基本权利的情况下，对维吾尔族和其他人进行任意拘留的程度可能构成国际罪行，特别是危害人类罪。”

法国维吾尔族学者、欧洲维吾尔学院院长迪丽努尔•热依汗（Dilnur Reyhan）在七五事件14周年前夜回答媒体提问时特别指出；近年来在新疆的大批抓捕并被关入官方所说的“职业培训中心“的人中，很多都是当地的维吾尔族精英。在她看来，所谓维汉问题的关键所在，是殖民冲突。她强调，北京当局在新疆的镇压行动与维吾尔人的宗教信仰完全无关，将维吾尔人遭遇归结为伊斯兰信仰对于那些并非穆斯林却被关押的维吾尔人来说太不公平。

维吾尔人的遭遇虽然如今获得国际社会广泛关注，但新疆的关押中心并没有消失。得以流亡海外的维吾尔人也并没有真正摆脱恐惧。世维会发言人迪里夏提回复本台书面采访时表示：“维吾尔难民面临中国多种方式跨国镇压的威胁，即使是逃离中国的维吾尔人也面临被遣返的危险，承受着巨大的压力。”

# A Uyghur Remembers the Urumqi Massacre

[A Uyghur Remembers the Urumqi Massacre](https://bitterwinter.org/a-uyghur-remembers-the-urumqi-massacre/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=11726773838&gbraid=0AAAAAC6C3PfKz7xv0o6VRGnC6xuEvMFzH&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9KTx4LWJjgMV5KVmAh3xQxrmEAAYASAAEgJXXPD_BwE)

## The killing of Uyghur slave workers in Shaoguan, Guangdong, on May 26, 2009 was the cause of what happened in Urumqi on July 5.

Every time, when we remember the Shaoguan Massacre, our resentment towards China worsens, not only for the numbers of victims but also for their painful death. Dozens of Uyghur slave laborers who were transferred from Konisheher [County](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/county/), Kashgar [prefecture](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/prefecture/) to Shaoguan City, Guangdong [province](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/province/), had never thought they would be painfully beaten to death on May 26, 2009. 

On that day, thousands of Han Chinese workers broke into their dormitories and pulled them down from their beds. They beat them with wooden and iron sticks until some died. They accused them of flirting with Han Chinese female workers. The video clips of running Uyghur workers chased and viciously beaten went viral online.

Though I was living in Netherlands, I paid close attention to the news of East Turkestan (Ch. [Xinjiang](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/xinjiang/)). The video clips of chasing and beating Uyghur workers were hotly debated online. According to statistics, 17 Uyghur workers died on that day.

In response to the brutal massacre, thousands of students, most of them very young, organized a demonstration in front of the government building of the so-called [Xinjiang](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/xinjiang/) Uyghur [Autonomous Region](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/autonomous-region/) in Urumqi. They demanded that the government should give an explanation about the Shaoguan Massacre, stop forcible transfer of Uyghur laborers to Han-dominated provinces, and solve unemployment problems within East Turkestan. However, the police and army forces opened fire on the protesters, causing more casualties. The videos of police shooting towards protesters and police beating protesters also became widespread online.

During the protest, police forces and soldiers used newly developed sulfur guns that attach the protesters’ clothing and are impossible to wash away. After arresting them during the night, they checked the imprints left on the cloths to ascertain whether they had been part of the protest. Electricity was cut in the residential areas where [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/) were primarily residing, and the soldiers broke into houses and arrested and killed [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/) arbitrarily.

The video clips of Han Chinese beating and killing Uyghur slave workers in Shaohuan city were rather violent and disturbing, and they circulated on Internet for weeks, infuriating many [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/). Curiously they had never been banned by the otherwise effective Chinese Internet police, even though they prove who initiated the riots.

More evidence clearly indicates that it was a political plot deliberately planned by the Chinese government. Several witnesses reported that the [CCP](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/ccp/) regional secretary Wang Lequan and other officials were having fun at the tourist attraction called the South Mountain of Urumqi at the time when the police were using sulfur guns to mark protesters and arresting and killing them under the cover of darkness.

In the night of July 5, several Uyghur youths resident in Dong Kowruck (Erdaoqiao), Beige Meidani (Horseracing Road), Dawan Road (Hill Road) were killed. The bodies were shifted by army vehicles, and bloodstains were washed throughout all night under the cover of darkness.

Wang Lequan described this massacre on TV as “a strong strike back against radicals.” Inspired by Wang Lequan’s implicit guarantee of no punishment, thousands of Han Chinese descended on Uyghur densely resided areas and killed or injured all the [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/) they saw, by using wooden and iron sticks, without any interference by the police. A witness stated that 20-30 plainclothes policemen went on a rampage, killing even the elderly and the children. Not surprisingly, this exasperated the Uyghur feelings towards the Han, and was the root cause of the violence that followed.

When the July 5 massacre took place, the Chinese President Hu Jintao abruptly returned to Beijing from Italy where he was attending the G8 meeting and ordered a heavy crackdown. He also ordered to blame the [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/) for the riots.

Memetjan Abdulla, a reporter of China Radio International (CRI), sentenced to life imprisonment in April 2010 for “instigating ethnic rioting” and for posting the [World Uyghur Congress](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/world-uyghur-congress/)’s statement, called [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/) around the world to protest about the Shaoguan incident on the Uyghur-language website _Salkin._

GulmireImin_,_ web administrator for the Uyghur-language website and a government employee in Urumqi, was sentenced to life in April 2010 for posting calls for a demonstration asking justice on the Salkin website.

Geyret Niyaz, a classmate of former chairperson of the [Xinjiang](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/xinjiang/) Uyghur [Autonomous Region](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/autonomous-region/) Nur Bekri’, and a former journalist at the [Xinjiang](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/xinjiang/) Economic Daily, was sentenced to 15 years in jail for providing suggestions to the government about how to solve the problem and for accepting interviews from foreign journalists.

Ilham Tohti, an internationally famous professor of economics, and host at the Uyghur Onlinewebsite, was sentenced to life imprisonment on September 23, 2014, for “inciting separatism” after he had called for the respect of [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/)’ [human rights](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/human-rights/). Tohti had criticized the Chinese government on the July 5 Massacre by saying, “This is not an incident but a result of the harsh politics of Chinese government towards Uyghur people.”

Sophie Richardson, the China director at [Human Rights](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/human-rights/) Watch, mentioned how China accelerated the militarization of the Uyghur region after the Shaoguan massacre and the Urumqi riots. She also showed admiration for the Uyghur people courage and bravery in facing oppression.

In the history of Chinese oppression of the [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/), physical repression and even massacres are not incidents. They are part of a policy aimed at terrorizing [Uyghurs](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/uyghurs/), using various pretexts, with the final goal of eliminating them, if not physically, by destroying their identity and culture. The Shaoguan massacre was the forerunner of many others, and confirms that China fully deserves to be designated as a terrorist state.

## [Life in Xinjiang after 7.5 (Urumqi Riots)](https://www.farwestchina.com/blog/life-in-xinjiang-after-75/)

How did the Urumqi riots of 2009 change the way people lived in Xinjiang, China? During the months that followed the riots, quite a few newsworthy events continued to shape life in Xinjiang, including the syringe scare and the outbreak of H1N1.

As always, keep in mind that this all comes from personal observation and is limited in scope to my small city.

This will hopefully give you a better idea of how things changed in Xinjiang following the riots.

- **Security forces** are still visible all throughout the province, including along the highway checkpoints and especially near the mosques.  It has been reported that over 20,000 troops have been deployed all throughout the province and there is no hint that they’ll be leaving soon.
- **Buses in many cities are now staffed by a government employee** whose sole job is to ensure passenger safety.  Like air marshals, they’re usually plain-clothed and they are, more than likely, a direct response to the syringe attacks.
- **Bags are being checked in all major shopping areas**.  It’s not clear what they’re looking for, but the personnel checking the bags are regular employees, not police.

- **Long distance calling has been shut down even tighter**.  While previously I could use a specific phone card to call home or at least receive incoming calls late at night, it seems that this “loophole” has been discovered and fixed.  Communication with my family is virtually nil right now.
- **Dunhuang has become Xinjiang’s most important city**.  And it’s not even located within Xinjiang…it’s in Gansu!  Pretty much the first city outside of Xinjiang with internet access, Dunhuang has become the place for all businessmen and foreigners to go to regain access to email and business contacts.  Hotels and coffee shops tell me they’ve seen a noticeable increase in Xinjiang traffic.
- **Wanted posters** were plastered all over each neighborhood in August showing color photos of both those who have been arrested and those suspects who are still at large.  This group of about 30 mug shots include mostly Uyghur men but also boasts a couple women and Han Chinese.
- **Every child must have their temperature taken before entering the school** premises.  If they leave during the lunch period they must take the temperature again upon returning.  Any person entering the hospital with a temperature is immediately quarantined.

[](https://www.linkev.com/?offer=3monthsfree&a_aid=farwestchina&data1=fwc&data2=banner)

- **Travel during the holiday was strongly discouraged.** Since we’re foreigners and we needed to get on the internet we were allowed, but we first had to get permission from the local police bureau before we left.  Every single one of our Chinese friends stayed home for the October holiday following the request of our employer.
- **The internet is rumored to remain closed until late next year**.  This is the most discouraging to me.  I’m not sure what advantage there is to keeping this province in the dark until April or May, but even my friend within the city government told me not to expect anything until at least the Chinese New Year.  I’ve heard that our neighbors to the south are in the same situation but I’m not quite sure.

So that about covers it.  We’re not suffering over here but things have definitely changed.  With every day that goes by these changes become more and more routine to the point that it’s almost considered “normal”.  

Personally I take comfort in many of these points, I just hope that in the future all of this won’t be necessary.

The Urumqi Riots and China’s Ethnic Policy in Xinjiang SHAN Wei and CHEN Gang* The Urumqi riots revealed deep-rooted ethnic tensions in China and called into question Beijing’s ethnic policies. Ethnical minorities in China enjoy preferential policies in education, family planning, judicial treatment and other areas, but they also face heavy regulations in religious activities. These policies, in combination with economic inequalities between the Han and other groups, have manifested grievances and resentment within the religious minorities. ON 5 JULY 2009, the Urumqi riots, the deadliest ethnic violence in decades, revealed deep-rooted ethnic tensions intertwined with religious issues in this region of China and called into question the underlying principles of the Party’s “ethnic policies” (minzu zhengce). Urumqi is the capital city of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the largest provincial jurisdiction in China. Among the 21 million residents in Xinjiang, around 46% are Uyghurs, 39% are Hans, and seven percent are Kazaks; the other 44 ethnic groups take up the rest at eight percent. Most Uyghurs and Kazaks are Muslims. In the city of Urumqi, the majority is Han Chinese (73%), while the Uyghurs only account for 12.3% of the total population. * SHAN Wei is Visiting Research Fellow at the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore. CHEN Gang is Research Fellow at the same institute. 14 east asian policy The 2009 Xinjiang riots were sparked off by an earlier small-scale fight between Han and Uyghur workers in late June and thousands of miles away in Shaoguan, Guangdong province. The incident later snowballed into an unprecedented outbreak of large-scale communal riots and ended with a death toll of 184, according to the figure released by the Chinese government on 11 July 2009. The ripple effect shows the power of modern communications, such as cell phones and Internet, and its employment by anti-government agents, both inside and outside China, to instigate and aggravate sensitive events.Official figures showed 137 of the victims belonged to the dominant Han ethnic group, and the rest included 46 Uyghurs, and one man of the Hui Muslim ethnic group. The riots, called by some Chinese commentators as the Chinese version of “9/11,” had taken Beijing by surprise and shocked the top leadership, so serious and crucial that President Hu Jintao had to cut short his Europe tour and cancelled his participation at the G8 summit. Such an abrupt change of a paramount leader’s diplomatic activities is rare in history, implying that other leaders including Premier Wen Jiabao and heir-apparent Xi Jinping are incapable of handling the crisis without Hu, the only leader empowered to mobilise and coordinate civil security and military forces. Domestically, the communal riots have seriously called into question China’s major policies towards ethnic minorities, the goal of building a “harmonious society” and the much publicised western development strategy. Although China’s ethnic policies have made several achievements, they do not function well in Xinjiang where local ethnic groups have their own languages and cultural identities and The riots, called by some Chinese commentators as the Chinese version of “9/ 11,” had taken Beijing by surprise and shocked the top leadership, so serious and crucial that President Hu Jintao had to cut short his Europe tour and cancelled his participation at the G8 summit. religions. Evidently, Beijing has learned a lesson from its handling of the aftermath of the Tibet riots in March 2008 and has developed a more sophisticated, multifaceted public relations strategy. Subsequent to the Tibet riots in spring 2008, the government immediately banned the entry of foreign reporters but was slow to shut down cell phones and Internet services. This time, the Chinese government opened the restive region to foreign media but censored online sources of information and suspended cell phone services in Xinjiang. The western media continued its biased reports on the Xinjiang riots but refrained from China bashing this time. To many westerners, Tibetan Buddhists, represented by their spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, are peace-loving people repressed by the Chinese government. The “East Turkestan Independence Movement” by some Muslim Uyghurs, however, has often been linked to terrorism and extremism in central Asia. 15 east asian policy After the American “9/11” Beijing succeeded in getting the recognition from the United States that some Xinjiang separatists are connected to jihadist terrorism, but the World Uyghur Congress led by Rebiya Kadeer, who advocates non-violence protests and is accused by Beijing of instigating the riots, was funded by the bipartisan National Endowment for Democracy sponsored by the US Congress. The Muslim-related riots have affected China’s relations with Islamic countries, with which China has been cultivating good relations for years due to their large influence in third world countries and strategic importance to China’s energy security. Turkey, a country where many Uyghurs have sought refuge, has asked the UN Security Council to discuss ways to end ethnic violence in Xinjiang. China rejected the call immediately, saying the incident was an internal affair. Iran has also voiced concern over the clashes in Xinjiang. In a telephone conversation with Secretary General of the 56-nation Organisation of the Islamic Conference Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki voiced Iran’s support for “the rights of Chinese Muslims”. China’s ethnic policy is a combination of imperial legacy and Chinese style affirmative action. Ethnic minorities enjoy a number of preferential policies in education (i.e., priority in college admission), family planning (i.e., more than one child), legal issues (i.e., lenient treatment in litigations) and special quota system (i.e., overrepresented seats in congress and government). Ironically, those supposedly favourable policies and arrangements which were designed to promote national integration have exacerbated the rift between the Han and other ethnic groups. Rapid economic growth has widened income gaps (as in other parts of China) across ethnic groups and caused disgruntlement among minorities. To solve the unemployment of Uyghur youths, the government has made efforts to bring some of them to factories in coastal areas, but the effort has backfired and became the direct cause of the riots. Also, the tight restrictions on religious practice further alienate ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Yet there is still room to address ethnic relation problems, even after the Urumqi riots. The Uyghurs have a strong ethnic identity as well as a high level of Chinese identity, which means they would be willing to be Chinese if their ethnic culture and identity are respected. Beijing may need to adjust its ethnic policy. Measures should be taken to help minorities foster the Chinese identity, while allowing them to preserve their own languages, religions and cultures. Some of the preferential policies, which caused tensions between Hans and minorities, have to be changed. The government needs to enhance efforts in narrowing economic inequalities across ethnic groups and make the economic growth benefit all groups equally. In the long run, China may need to learn from the Singaporean model of “community bonding” and promote harmonious co-existence of ethnic groups with different languages, different values and different beliefs. China’s Ethnic Policy in Xinjiang Xinjiang officially became a Chinese province during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). Under the Republic of China (the Kuomintang government) rule, with secret aid from Britain, rebellions led to the establishment of a short-lived Turkish Islamic Republic of 16 east asian policy East Turkestan (1933–1934). After winning the Chinese civil war in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party and its army reasserted control of Xinjiang region. In the early days, General Wang Zhen (1908-1993), a famous CCP hardliner, was assigned to establish Chinese control over Xinjiang. He subdued the area with harsh measures. With a population of 105,500, the first army corps and the 22nd army corps under his leadership were later converted into a production unit (The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, xinjiang shengchan jianshe bingtuan), ushering a new wave of massive migration of Hans in Xinjiang. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was established in October 1955, occupying 1.66 million square kilometres or one sixth of China’s total territory. During the radical Cultural Revolution period (1966 76), many injustices were done against ethnic minorities, and their religions and ethnic cultures got suppressed. The late 1970s witnessed the start of more open policies, and since then, the Chinese government has relaxed restrictions on religions. The pillar of China’s current ethnic policies is regional autonomy for ethnic minorities (minzu quyu zizhi), which allows ethnic minorities to occupy top administrative and legislative posts and many official slots in autonomous areas. Yet some radicals criticise such “autonomy” as a sham because in most autonomous regions, the No. 1 power holder, namely the Party Secretary, is still a Han Chinese. Ironically, those supposedly favourable policies and arrangements which were designed to promote national integration have exacerbated the rift between the Han and other ethnic groups. Rapid economic growth has widened income gaps (as in other parts of China) across ethnic groups and caused disgruntlement among minorities. Beijing takes the view that economic development can eventually reduce Uyghur’s inclination towards independence and solve Xinjiang’s ethnic problems. Since the 1980s the state has adopted a set of favourable economic policies such as tax exemption and reduction in autonomous regions. For instance, new ethnic enterprises in these areas are exempted from tax in their first three years of operation. Since 2003 Xinjiang’s GDP growth has been higher than that for China as a whole. The Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law that was first promulgated in 1984 guaranteed a number of preferential policies for ethnic minorities, including more than one child for each couple, priorities in college admission, and a special quota system in political representation. In criminal and civil cases authorities throughout the country tend to adopt a more lenient attitude towards ethnic minorities for the sake of preserving ethnic unity. In 1984 the government announced the famous Two-Restraints-and-One-Leniency policy (liangshao yikuan). It requires law enforcers to “go easy on minority criminals 17 east asian policy by being restrained in pursuing and prosecuting crimes committed by minorities and treating them leniently”. This policy has discouraged local police from taking immediate action when they encounter minority suspects, and consequently fostering rampant crimes committed by certain ethnic groups and angering the Han Chinese. Although China’s Constitution recognises the freedom of such religions as Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism and Buddhism, the atheist government has imposed a lot of de facto restrictions to tightly regulate religious activities. According to governmental rules in Xinjiang, the imam’s sermon at Friday Prayer must run no longer than a half hour, and prayer in public areas outside the mosque is forbidden. Government workers and Communist Party members are prohibited from attending services at the mosque. Some students in public institutions were banned from fasting during Ramadan. Beijing’s Dilemmas Economic Inequalities The unprecedented violence in the July 5th riots calls into question China’s ethnic policies. The first problem is economic inequality. While the Chinese government has invested a lot in Xinjiang in the past decades to improve the minorities’ economic wellbeing, it fails to diminish the income gaps across ethnicities. Figure 1 reports how the Han and minorities in different regions of China evaluate their family economic conditions in the past five years. The question in the survey is “in comparison with five years ago, what is the economic situation of your family?” The answers provide a 1-5 scale of measure: much better (5), better (4), not changed (3), worse (2), or much worse (1). The figure shows that there are evidently perceived gaps between the Han and minorities (the gaps in the central and west regions are statistically FIGURE 1 PERCEIVED FAMILY ECONOMIC WELLBEING IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS IN CHINA Source: Asian Barometer, 2008 18 east asian policy significant). The Han from all regions reported that the economic situation of their family was better off than five years earlier. The minorities in the Central and Western regions (where Uyghurs and Tibetans live), in contrast, perceived fewer gains in welfare than their Han counterparts, though they also felt better off than five years earlier. At the early stages, economic growth always brings about widening income inequalities. In Xinjiang, however, such inequality runs across the ethnic cleavages. The modern industries brought by the Han depressed many traditional Uyghur handicrafts industries and commerce. Culturally, the Han people are more enterprising than the Uyghurs in the market economy. As the Hans are inclined to conduct business through personal social networks, it is not easy for minorities, who are largely outside the social networks, to acquire business opportunities or employment in the Han dominant market. Hence, in the perception of the Uyghurs, rapid economic growth only benefits the Hans and they are victims of Han exploitation. While the government has spent billions of dollars in Xinjiang on infrastructure and welfare projects, and a huge amount of fiscal subsidies from Beijing have gone to the minority areas to support those projects, the Uyghurs tend not to perceive them as beneficial. They believe that those projects only bring about the influx of more Han people who will take up new job opportunities and become rich, while the wealth should belong to them (the Uyghurs) and not the incomers. The fact is that Xinjiang is a landlocked province. Regional development is difficult without linkage to the rest of the country. Its natural resources cannot benefit the While the government has spent billions of dollars in Xinjiang on infrastructure and welfare projects, and a huge amount of fiscal subsidies from the Beijing have gone to the minority areas to support those projects, the Uyghurs tend not to perceive them as beneficial. They believe that those projects only bring about the influx of more Han people who will take up new job opportunities and become rich … natives if they are not able to bring the resources to market. The Uyghur need to establish a good relationship with the Han in order to achieve economic prosperity. Preferential Ethnic Policies Beijing has practised preferential policies in favour of minorities in a number of areas. In education, minorities receive priorities in college admission; in family planning, minorities are allowed to have more than one child; in legal affairs, minority suspects receive lenient treatment. These preferential policies have heightened the ethnic consciousness of the minorities and the Han, sharpening the ethnic divide. 19 east asian policy These preferential policies have failed to produce their intended results. Minorities are generally not happy with their treatment, and the Han complain about “reverse discrimination.” Due to preferential employment (the government requires 15% of the employees, including management positions, in state-owned enterprises to be ethnic minorities in Xinjiang), many Uyghurs do not even need to show up for work but still get paychecks. Because of the preferential education policy, many Han youths lose their chance of college education to minority students who have lower scores in college entrance examination. The Two-Restraints-and-One-Leniency policy has been a source of resentment among the Han Chinese. Under this policy, many Uyghurs have behaved irresponsibly and treated their Han neighbours roughly. For instance, many Hans in Xinjiang have been forced to buy products from Uyghur vendors, otherwise, these vendors would use violence against them without legal ramifications. As a result, the Han have developed some racial profiling of the Uyghurs. The Policy towards Religion The CCP’s religion policy in Xinjiang has manifested grievances within the Uyghur community. Muslims take offence at any attempts by the government or other ethnic groups to constrain their religious practices such as fasting. But the CCP has been adamant about controlling religious activities, especially in Xinjiang and Tibet. Even though the government has relaxed its control over religions in the past decade, its religious policies are still too restrictive. Because of its atheist ideology, the CCP is essentially anti-religion. Hence Party leaders do not fully appreciate the centrality of religious life for some ethnic groups. Their anti-religious attitudes have been enhanced by their perception that religious organisations are often involved in separatist activities instigated and organised by exile leaders abroad, posing a major threat to China’s national security. Heavy-handed restrictions on Islam have radicalised many Muslim Uyghurs, as some scholars argued. Because of the restrictions, many Muslims join underground Koran study groups, where the imams teach the divine scripts as well as the political blueprints of an independent East Turkestan. In turn, the government takes it as a justification for more harsh control over religion. Beijing Needs to Adjust Its Ethnic Policy What is abundantly clear is that China will never allow Xinjiang to become independent. However, as there are 46 ethnic minority groups which occupy more than 60 percent of the population, Beijing needs to find a way to promote a harmonious relationship between the Han and the minority groups in Xinjiang. Although there are such massive tensions between the Hans and Uyghurs, a reconciliation is not inconceivable. It is true that the Uyghur have a strong ethnic identity associated with their religion and language. However, some academic researches revealed that they also have a relatively high level of Chinese identity, even higher than the American identity of Latinos in the United States and the Russian identity of Tartars in Russia. 20 east asian policy Moreover, the Uyghurs and the Hans can be good friends. According to one survey, 70.1% of the Uyghurs have Han friends and 82.3% of the Hans have Uyghur friends. Clearly, if and only if their ethnic identity (i.e., their own language, their religion and their lifestyle) could be preserved, Uyghur people in Xinjiang would not refuse to establish a Chinese identity. The question now is how to assure them that after all these violent riots, being a Chinese does not conflict with being a Uyghur. In the short term, Beijing needs to restore order in Xinjiang, ensuring both the Uyghurs and Hans that they can live and work safely. Offenders during the riots must be brought to justice regardless of their ethnic statuses. In the long run, however, Beijing may need to fundamentally adjust its current ethnic policy. First of all, the CCP will have to change its ideological prejudice against religion and allow ethnic minorities to practise their religions freely. Beijing may also want to make greater efforts to reduce the income gaps between the Hans and other ethnic groups. More resources are needed to promote employment and improve the education of minority youths. The government should do more to encourage minorities to learn Chinese and speak Mandarin for them to work in the public sector and to go into modern sector employment. At the same time, the Beijing leadership should modify its social policy towards ethnic minorities. While encouraging minorities to speak Mandarin and accept national laws to achieve national integration, accommodating minority languages, values and customs should also become one of the basic principles of its public policy. The school curriculums in the minority areas need to include extensive content of ethnic languages and cultures. Substantial efforts need to be taken to restrain the Han people’s open prejudice against minorities, perhaps through formal education or legislation. The majority Han It is true that the Uyghur have a strong ethnic identity associated with their religion and language. However, some academic researches revealed that they also have a relatively high level of Chinese identity, even higher than the American identity of Latinos in the United States and the Russian identity of Tartars in Russia. should learn to respect people from different cultures and with different ways of life, and learn to be sensitive to behavioural codes and customs of other ethnic groups. All these policy adjustments require Beijing to take a thorough reflection on the system of regional autonomy for ethnic minorities. While this system has guaranteed some of the political and economic rights of minorities in the past decades, it has also sharpened the distinctions between different ethnicities. To make it worse, as many 21 east asian policy scholars noted, with clearly defined population and geographic sphere some minorities have succeeded in nurturing their ethnic consciousness as well as a predisposition to ethnic independence. China may want to learn from the Singaporean experience to promote “community bonding” among all ethnic groups. The focus should be on promoting national integration and establishing an identity of the Chinese Nation (Zhonghua Minzu). Ethnic status should only be culturally important and have no political significance. Preferential policies that give minorities certain political and social privileges must be revised. All social members, regardless of racial or ethnic or religious backgrounds, should be equal citizens within the country, comply with the country’s constitution and laws, and display mutual respect. Only in this way can all ethnic groups with different languages, different values and different beliefs live in harmony and peace within the multi-ethnic state of the Chinese nation

# Uyghur Americans commemorate 15th anniversary of Urumqi massacre in US capital city

[Uyghur Americans commemorate 15th anniversary of Urumqi massacre in US capital city](https://www.indianarrative.com/world-news/uyghur-americans-commemorate-15th-anniversary-of-urumqi-massacre-in-us-capital-city-159118.html)

Uyghur Americans commemorated the 15th anniversary of the Urumqi Massacre in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC. The Uyghur Americans Association shared pictures of the protest on X.

In a post on X on Friday, the Uyghur Americans Association stated, “Uyghur Americans commemorated the 15th anniversary of the Urumchi Massacre in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., today.”

The tragic events unfolded on July 5, 2009 as thousands of Uyghurs took to the streets in a march towards the People’s Square in central Urumchi to protest the Chinese government’s handling of the Shaoguan incident.

A large number of people were killed and sustained injuries in three days of violence between ethnic minority Uyghurs and Han Chinese that began on July 5, 2009, in Xinjiang’s largest city, Urumqi. This incident involved the deaths of several Uyghurs at the hands of a mob of Chinese factory workers during a dispute.

The 15th anniversary of the Urumqi Massacre was marked by various groups and individuals concerned with human rights, Uyghur advocacy, and remembrance of the victims. These events typically serve as a platform to raise awareness about the Urumqi Massacre, commemorate the victims, and advocate for justice and accountability.

There are several significant issues concerning Uyghurs in China. Reports from various sources indicate that Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region face widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention, forced labour, forced assimilation practices, and religious and cultural repression.

The Chinese government has been accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in internment camps under the pretext of combating extremism and terrorism. These camps are reported to subject detainees to indoctrination, abuse, and harsh conditions.

According to reports, Xinjiang is heavily monitored through surveillance technologies, including facial recognition, AI-driven monitoring systems, and mass data collection.

On July 5, The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), an Uyghur rights organisation based in Munich, Germany in a statement released on Friday, condemned the Chinese authorities for the atrocities they inflicted upon the Uyghur community of East Turkistan.

The WUC slammed Beijing and stated that the country must take responsibility for atrocities in the East Turkestan/Xinjiang region, and compensate the victims for the losses they had suffered.

In a post on X, World Uyghur Congress stated, “On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Urumchi massacre, the WUC & @GfbV demand that the government must finally recognise its responsibility for the massacre of the Uyghurs in East Turkistan and compensate the victims.”

2009年5月：新疆青年“自愿”南下进厂—— 工资低、工时长、汉维生活习惯冲突—— 被辞退员工怀忿在网络散布“维吾尔人强奸2个汉族女孩”——

6月：一名迷路的汉族女孩闯进维吾尔男性宿舍，因为觉得不友好而尖叫—— 汉族男工人误认为汉女遭到维吾尔人强奸，持棍棒铁管冲入维吾尔宿舍殴打维族人 —— 维族人反击双方演变成械斗—— “当参与斗殴的疏附县员工离开斗殴现场后，被告人肖建华、许其琪、蒋景、廖谱生、沈文庆伙同他人仍不肯罢休，分别持铁管等工具，对多名未参与斗殴的疏附县员工进行殴打，造成阿西木江·艾麦提、萨迪克江·喀则死亡、３人重伤、６人轻伤。其中，被告人肖建华、许其琪参与了对阿西木江·艾麦提等人的殴打，肖建华还用铁管进行威胁，阻止医护人员救治伤员。”

7月5日：上千名民众发起要求对斗殴进行全面调查的游行—— 警方抓捕示威领导者——暴力升级，维族中极端分子开始无差别袭击汉人 7月6日：伤亡大增，警方抓捕大量维族男性控制事态 7月7日：汉族进行大规模游行暴力报复 7月8日后事件得以逐步平息。

中共将此事件归结于“有组织有阴谋的境外三股势力疆独分裂分子的暴力事件”。

没有替暴恐分子洗白的意图，只是第一次知道原来事件起因是这样的。之前也看过7.5的纪录片，一直以为起因是维吾尔人在QQ上听信了维族人在广东被打S的谣言才引发的……没想到居然这个谣言是真的，而且背后有这么复杂的问题。

这只是压垮骆驼的最后一个稻草，背后有深刻复杂的原因。

其背景就是长达十多年的维族独立运动，加上tg宣传失败，导致新疆维族自信心爆棚。导致7.5屠杀

其实新疆维族就是瞎搞，你一个少数民族杀主体民族就是作死。但是维系历史习惯作死。

然后就是汉族全面反杀，中央靠妥协来保持维族不闹事彻底破产。既然无法妥协就严厉镇压。不过西二的治理太tmd烂了

你猜为什么会怀疑是维维强奸的？因为真的干过。

两少一宽这玩意的历史可是和二共历史差不多长的。

两少一宽这是啥脑子才能想出来的，民族政策处理还是学俄罗斯，就该强硬，一味的绥靖没有任何好处，拿汉人的血补助少民，中国果然是异族统治-

这套区分民族，牺牲主体民族补贴少数民族的政策，就是从苏联爹那抄过来的

哥们，一共虽然也有优待，但是wg时候真能让清真寺养猪的。两少一宽最大责任人可是胡耀邦赵紫阳，这两人再怎么说也和“左派”，“苏联”扯不上任何关系吧

我查了下说是彭真这SB提出来的，得到了胡耀邦的认可- 毛还是手太软，文革时就该弄死这东西-

中国的少民政策就是一坨狗屎，维族被系统性歧视和维族犯罪不受惩罚是同时存在的两个不公，只是因为时间和空间的错位导致积怨在两头同时积累.

例如，A地警察依据严管政策要求歧视性区别对待维族, 审查严出省难给眼色，然后这个维族到了B地, 心理不平衡觉得汉族人欠了他一样，而B地的警察又被要求严格执行‘’两少一宽‘’，导致B地的汉人觉得维族人很有毛病.

然后因为消息和言论管制，这两种情况长期存在又长期无法互相沟通，维族人的苦被息事宁人，汉族人的苦也被息事宁人.

本质还是因为共产党是所有民族的压迫者导致的，他们不想解决问题，只想压制问题

另外还有一个现象是遇到大型矛盾时，中共会将与汉族群体 A 的矛盾转移到汉族群体 B 身上，叫汉族群体 B 给汉族群体 A 当替死鬼。因为汉族群体 A 更值钱。

7.5 时新疆的汉族人很明显的是给香港和广东的汉族人当替死鬼的。

我从小就知道两种人很具有攻击性 一种是哑巴 很难沟通 动不动就打人 一种就是维藏 也很难沟通 攻击性也很强 而且还经常带刀

这事儿我是第一时间知道的，当时不少论坛都在讨论，没想到后面发生了这么大的事

我猜你当时年纪比较小，那些天网上到处是这个工厂群殴的视频，三股势力利用了事件

谁跟你说这是起因的？

牛啊，谁说汉人费拉武德不行的

知道工厂不愿意收少数民族吗，苏州工厂收回回，最多一次只敢收1-2个，人一多就给你蹬鼻子上脸要求整个食堂不准有猪肉。

另外他们教主一般长期在清真市搞仇恨教育，陕甘回乱的问题全部归咎于汉人

人數一多要求單開食堂很正常吧

一般一个大点的厂就10-30号回回，不稳定，几天-几个月就提桶跑路。

这些都是二货。你知道后来tg怎么收拾的嘛，以前维族闹事，北京警察都的跪下来喊爷。7.5后，上海有个案例，回回砸了一家汉人店，上海警察直接抓人拆店。宁夏直接拆清真寺。

tg以前还是太仁慈了，维族以为是汉民软，后面是真收拾，抓人都是直接抄家，根本不走正常流程

听起来你可能是那种支持新疆集中营和新冠方舱的那种人。

少数民族跟汉族习惯不一样的。内地工厂那个氛围估计你去了也受不了，少数民族从历史上就是放牧为主整个文化是相对自由的，跟汉族习惯农耕圈禁和中央集权意识是很不同的。我觉得这点是他们不习惯工厂生活的主要原因。

那就不去呗，回回把钱都给真主了，几乎不接受现代教育，连古兰经都看不懂，只相信教主的话。俗话说的好客随主便，接受不了就不要去，去了想要鸠占鹊巢要求别人为你不到30号人单开食堂每周额外放假让你聚会做礼拜本来就赶工期的项目，不请假的人被累跑了，哪个老板能忍，人是有忍耐限度的。只要回回不改变这种问题就会不断重演
