### Overall Evaluation

The paper presents an innovative approach to improving personalized blood pressure (BP) estimation using a novel ensemble learning method called ATTE. The proposed method integrates age-group-guided fine-tuning with a two-level ensemble learning architecture, showing notable improvements over traditional methods. The research is highly relevant given the increasing demand for cuffless BP estimation systems and personalized medicine. The method demonstrates improvements in both systolic and diastolic BP accuracy, making it a promising step forward in this domain.

### Strengths

1. **Innovation and Relevance**: The incorporation of age-specific characteristics in BP estimation is a significant contribution. The paper provides valuable insights into how personalized fine-tuning can be optimized using ensemble learning, a novel application in the cuffless BP estimation domain.

2. **Methodological Soundness**: The two-level ensemble learning architecture, combining feature-level and result-level ensembles, is well-structured and addresses challenges in model uncertainty and generalization. The use of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) for result-level ensemble is particularly noteworthy.

3. **Data and Experimentation**: The experimental setup is rigorous, utilizing the MIMIC-III dataset and demonstrating the practical applicability of the method. The comparison with traditional transfer learning fine-tuning and other models is robust, and the results are convincing.

4. **Results**: The improvements in SBP and DBP estimation accuracy are clearly quantified, and the paper provides strong evidence for the superiority of the ATTE method over competing techniques.

5. **Interpretability**: The use of GradRAM for interpretability analysis adds a useful dimension to the study, enabling a better understanding of the model's decision-making process.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Clarity and Structure**:

	- The paper could benefit from clearer section transitions, especially between the Methodology and Results sections. The flow of ideas in the description of the ATTE method is occasionally dense and could be broken into more digestible parts.

	- The "Scaling Law" between source domain size and accuracy is a key observation but could be better integrated into the introduction to highlight its significance early in the paper.

2. **Method Design**:

	- While the age-group-guided fine-tuning approach is innovative, it would be beneficial to further explore how this method can be generalized to other physiological parameters beyond BP. A brief discussion on potential future applications or limitations in other healthcare scenarios would add value.

	- The paper mentions that as few as 50 labeled samples suffice for high-precision estimation, but a more detailed exploration of the computational efficiency and feasibility of this approach for real-world applications could be added, particularly in resource-limited settings.

3. **Comparative Experiments**:

	- Although comparisons with multiple BP estimation models are conducted, the paper could include more details on the limitations of these models in real-world scenarios, such as model robustness and scalability.

	- Additional comparison with state-of-the-art methods from recent literature (including non-Bayesian ensemble methods or alternative deep learning frameworks) would strengthen the case for the proposed methodâ€™s superiority.

4. **Data and Experimentation**:

	- While the dataset used is extensive, a discussion on potential biases or demographic gaps in the MIMIC-III dataset (e.g., underrepresentation of certain age or ethnic groups) could be helpful to ensure the generalizability of the findings.

5. **Figures and Tables**:

	- The figures and tables are useful but may require more detailed captions. Some of the visualizations (e.g., in Figure 9) could benefit from clearer labeling to explain the context of the data being visualized.

6. **Language and Expression**:

	- While the language is generally clear, there are occasional grammatical errors and some overly complex sentence structures that could be simplified. Proofreading and refinement would enhance the readability and flow of the paper.

### Recommendation

**Recommendation**: _Minor revisions required before acceptance_.

The paper presents an important and innovative contribution to the field of cuffless BP estimation. While the method is strong and well-supported by experiments, some areas of clarity, explanation, and comparative analysis could be improved. After addressing these minor revisions, the paper should be in a good position for acceptance.
